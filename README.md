This Library Management System (LMS) Project aims to develop software to efficiently manage a library's book collection. This system will ensure organization by storing books in a database, each with a unique identifier. Additional specifications, such as the author's name, genre, status, and due date will also be incorporated, among any other pertinent details. This LMS will operate as a console-based application, implementing a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern allowing each component to be developed and modified independently. 
## App Functionalities
- **Collection Management:** The user will be able to add and remove books from the collection.
- **Search Functionality:** The user must be able to search books by title or barcode.
- **Check-in/Check-out:** The user must be able to Track borrowed and returned book transactions, managing due dates and possible fines.
- **Display functionality:** The user must be able to visualize the entire content of the book collection.
